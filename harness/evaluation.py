"""Measuring advisor quality: how often does a second opinion get it wrong?

Phase 2 established that a cheap advisor is *economically rational* -- break-even
exposure around $0.0026 for Groq's 8b, well under the prices the x402 seller
charges. Rational-to-consult and *good* are different properties, and only the
first was demonstrated. Then a live run showed that advisor blocking a legitimate
$0.01 purchase, and an earlier one recommending REJECT on a routine $0.05 buy.

This harness measures the gap.

## Why false-blocks are the whole story

The clamp in `advise.py` means an advisor can only ever *tighten* a verdict. That
makes its failure mode one-sided:

* **False allow** -- advisor says APPROVE on something dangerous. Harmless: the
  deterministic verdict already stands, and the advisor cannot loosen it. The
  worst case is that it adds nothing.
* **False block** -- advisor says REVIEW/REJECT on something fine. This *does*
  change the outcome: a legitimate purchase is refused and the agent's task fails.

So an advisor cannot make the system less safe, only less useful. The metric that
matters is therefore the false-block rate on traffic that should pass, and that is
what `false_block_rate` reports.

Bad cases are still included, but as a **sensitivity** check: would the advisor
have caught a genuine problem if it had been the only line of defence? A model
that blocks everything scores perfectly there while being useless -- which is
precisely why it is reported alongside the false-block rate rather than alone.
